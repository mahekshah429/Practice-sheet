        HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
        HTML is a combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages.
        A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.
        This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly.
        Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text.

        An HTML element is set off from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". 
        The name of an element inside a tag is case-insensitive. That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mixture. 
        However, the convention and recommended practice is to write tags in lowercase.HTML elements are usually "inline-level" or "block-level" elements.
        An inline-level element occupies only the space bounded by the tags that define it. A block-level element occupies the entire space of its parent element (container), thereby creating a "block box".
        HTML is comprised of several kinds of content, each of which is allowed to be used in certain contexts and is disallowed in others. 
        Similarly, each context has a set of other content categories it can contain and elements that can or can't be used in them. This is a guide to these categories.
